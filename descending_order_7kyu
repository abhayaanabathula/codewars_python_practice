## Your task is to make a function that can take any non-integer as an 
## argument and return it with its digits in descending order. 
## Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

def descending_order(num):
    new_num = ()
    for i in str(num):
        new_num = sorted(str(num), reverse = True)
    return int(''.join(new_num));
